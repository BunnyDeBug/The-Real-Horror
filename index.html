<h3  class="paratitles">The Nightshift</h3>

<div class="paragraphs">
<p>- Sent by nightowl234<br> I don't talk about this much anymore, because every time I do people think I'm exaggerating,
or they laugh it off like it's one of those “creepy late-night stories” you tell around a fire.
But what happened was real, and I still haven't figured out a normal explanation for it.
Back in 2021, I worked night shift at a storage facility outside town.
It wasn't fancy—just long concrete corridors lined with metal roll-up doors,
the kind that slam so loudly you can feel it in your chest.
I usually brought a book or earbuds, because nothing ever happened.
Most nights were dead silent. But around the second month,
I started noticing noises I couldn't explain. It started with footsteps.
Not heavy ones—more like someone walking slowly in socks, dragging their heel a little.
The first few times, I thought it was echo from the wind pushing against the metal doors,
so I ignored it. But the footsteps always came from the same hallway,
the one with the broken motion sensor light that flickered like it was dying.
One night, around 1 a.m., I was doing my rounds when I heard the footsteps clear as day behind me.
I turned around immediately, expecting to see someone. Nobody.<br>
Just the long empty corridor and that stupid flickering light at the end.
I told myself it was just old pipes expanding, even though the sound had been so distinctly human. Still, I walked faster.
A little while later, I heard something I still can't explain.
I was checking the logbook inside the tiny office when one of the metal doors down the hall slammed shut. Hard. The building shook.
That door had been padlocked for months.
I grabbed my torch and walked down the hallway, calling out,
asking if someone was there. Every door was still locked tight. No footprints.
No signs of anyone forcing anything. Just the echo of my own breathing.<br>
I should've gone home after that, but I didn't want to get in trouble for abandoning the shift. So I stayed, sitting in the office with the door slightly open so I could hear if something moved again.
Around 3:40 a.m., something touched the office door. Not hard—just a slow drag,
like fingers trailing across the metal. I froze. The door moved maybe a centimetre,
like someone was leaning against it, listening. I didn't breathe. I didn't blink.
I just sat there staring at the gap between the door and the frame.
And then… someone whispered my name.
Not loudly. Not aggressively. Just… like they wanted me to hear it.
I swear on my life I had never told anyone I was working that night.
The only person who knew was my supervisor, and he was away on leave.
I slammed the door, locked it, and curled up behind the desk like a terrified kid.<br>
For the rest of the night I heard faint footsteps outside the door every few minutes—slow,
dragging, pacing footsteps. But every time I looked through the tiny window,
nobody was there. When the sun finally came up and the morning staff arrived,
everything went normal again. Footsteps gone. Doors untouched.
Cameras—of course—missed all of it because that was the one hallway with the broken feed.
I quit the next day. And the weirdest part? The new guard who took over my shift messaged me a week later. She asked if anything strange had ever happened in the building.
I didn't tell her anything. She just said, “Okay.
I only ask because last night I swear I heard someone whispering my name.” I've never been back since.

<h3  class="paratitles">The Path</h3>

<div class="paragraphs">
<p>Sent by user2015<br>I used to rent a tiny bachelor flat behind an old couple's house.
 My entrance was separate, down a long narrow path beside their garage.
 At night it was pitch black—no lights,
 no windows facing it, just a straight tunnel of darkness.
 One night I came home late from work.
 As I unlocked the gate at the start of the path, I heard footsteps ahead of me.
 Slow. Measured. Definitely human.
 I aimed my phone torch down the path,
 expecting to see the old man or maybe a neighbour cutting through.
 But the light hit nothing. Just the empty stretch of concrete.
 The footsteps stopped the second my light came on.
 I told myself it was echo from the street behind me and started walking.
 Halfway down the path, the footsteps started again—this time right behind me.
 Not far. Not faint. Close enough that I felt air move at my back.
 I spun around with my phone, but again the path was empty.
 I didn't walk the rest of the way—I ran. Slammed the flat door behind me.
 Locked everything. Told myself I was imagining it.
 I was fine until a few minutes later, when I went to close the curtains.
 They were already closed. I never close them when I leave.
 And written in the condensation on the inside of the glass was a single word: “RUN”.
 I moved out the next morning.
 I've never gone back, and I don't walk down narrow, dark paths anymore.</p></div>

<h3  class="paratitles">My Camping trip</h3>

<div class="paragraphs">
<p>Sent by TentBug03<br>I used to love camping.
 Real camping—no caravan parks, no other people, just a tent, a fire,
 and a quiet patch of bush. Two years ago,
 my cousin and I camped near a river on a piece of land his friend owned.
 No signal, no neighbours for kilometres. It was perfect. The first night was normal.
 We made a fire, cooked, talked nonsense until late. Around midnight,
 we heard branches snapping somewhere behind the tents.
 It sounded like someone walking, but heavier than a buck.
 We figured it was a warthog or something and ignored it. Animals wander.
 It's normal. The second night, though… that's when things went bad.
 We were already half-asleep when the footsteps started again—slow, crunching,
 circling the tents. I whispered to my cousin,
 and he whispered back that he could see a shadow outside his tent through the fabric.
 A tall one. Standing completely still.
 I thought he was messing with me until something touched my tent. 
 Just one slow drag of fingers along the side. I stopped breathing.
 It wasn't an animal. Animals don't move like that.
 Animals don't feel their way around canvas.
 I grabbed my torch, unzipped the tent a centimetre,
 and flashed the light outside. Nothing. Just trees and the dead fire.
 I didn't sleep after that. Around 4 a.m., I heard my cousin's tent zip open fast.
 I jumped out of mine, thinking something attacked him.
 But he was standing there pale as chalk, pointing to the ground.
 Between our tents were footprints. Human footprints. Bare feet.
 They walked in a perfect circle around us, and then off into the bush.
 The weirdest part? The prints were fresh.
 But the ground around them was covered in heavy dew.
 Meaning someone had been standing out there long after the rest of the earth had gone wet—watching us.
 We packed up and left before sunrise.
 I still camp, but never without other people nearby.
 And never again in a place where footsteps can sneak up on you in the middlen of the night.

<h3 class="paratitles">Online Stranger</h3>

<div class="paragraphs">
<p>Sent by anonymous283<br>I never thought much about online strangers. I'm careful, 
I don't overshare, and I never post my location.
 So when I started chatting with someone on a hobby app, it felt harmless.
 They had a normal profile— selfies, pets, friends, everything looked real.
 They were friendly, funny, and even knew some things about my town. Nothing creepy.
 Not at first.

But after about two weeks, the messages started getting weird.
 They'd say things like, <i>“You look tired tonight,”</i> right after I posted nothing but a meme.
 Or, <i>“Long day at work?”</i> even though I never told them my shifts.
 I brushed it off as lucky guesses until one evening they said,
 <i>“Why did you change your hair? The dark colour suited you better.”</i>
I hadn't posted a single new picture. Not anywhere.

I blocked them immediately,
but twenty minutes later I got a message request
from a brand-new account: <i>“Blocking me won't help.”</i>
I reported it, blocked again.

The next day, I woke up to a text message. On my actual number.
Unknown caller ID.
It simply said: <i>“You walk fast when you're scared.”</i>

I felt my stomach drop because the night before, walking home from the store,
I swore I heard someone behind me but saw nothing when I checked.
I convinced myself it was in my head.

Two days later, I got a photo from another unknown number.
It was me.
Standing at my front door.
Taken from somewhere behind the bushes.

No threats. No demands. No explanation.
Just proof that whoever I'd been talking to online wasn't someone behind a screen anymore.

I moved apartments within the week, changed my number, deleted the app,
everything. And for months, nothing happened.

Then yesterday, a new account followed me on a completely different platform.
No posts, no picture, no bio.
The username was just one word:

<b>“Foundyou.”</b>

I haven't slept since.</p></div>


<h3 class="paratitles">The Man</h3>

<div class="paragraphs"><p>Sent by bigdoglover01<br>I was walking home from work late one night.
The streets were quiet, almost too quiet,
the kind of silence that makes you double-check your surroundings.
As I passed the small park near my apartment, 
I noticed a man sitting on a bench, hunched over, head in their hands. 
I didn't think much of it, he was probably drunk or sad. None of my business.
I kept walking.

A few minutes later, I heard footsteps behind me. Not fast, just steady,
matching my pace perfectly. I glanced over my shoulder. There was the man from the bench.
I sped up.
He sped up. I started to jog. He did too. My heart was hammering.

I rounded the corner onto my street, just a block from my apartment building.
I could see the lights on inside, the door unlocked.
Relief hit me. But then I saw the man at the end of the street.
Standing completely still, just watching me.

I ran the last few metres to my door, slammed it shut, and locked it.
My apartment was tiny, with only one window, but I still checked it. Nothing.
No movement, no sound, just the faint echo of those footsteps fading down the street.

I don't know who it was. I never saw them again. But every time I walk home late now,
I can't shake the feeling that someone is counting my steps.

<h3 class="paratitles">The Intruder</h3>

<div class="paragraphs"><p>Sent by user552<br>I was alone at home that night because my husband was working late.
It was around 11 p.m., and I was half-asleep on the couch with the TV playing quietly.
That's when I heard it—just a small sound, like metal tapping metal.
I paused the TV and listened. Nothing. I figured it was the wind pushing the gate, 
so I ignored it.

Five minutes later, I heard it again. This time louder.
A clear, sharp click, like someone testing a door handle.

I muted the TV and sat completely still.
Another click.
Then a slow creak.

It came from the kitchen door.

My heart jumped into my throat.
That door always swells shut in winter; it takes force to open.
But now it was opening… slowly… like someone was easing it open a few millimetres at a time.
I grabbed my phone and backed into the hallway, trying not to breathe too loud.

The house went dead silent.

Then I heard footsteps—soft ones, but heavy enough that I knew it wasn't the wind.
Someone was in my kitchen, moving carefully,
like they knew exactly how to step without making noise.

I ducked into the bathroom and locked the door.
My hands were shaking so badly I barely managed to dial emergency services.
While the operator asked for my address,
I could hear the intruder moving down the hall… straight toward me.

When they stopped outside the bathroom door,
I pressed my hand over my mouth to keep from sobbing.
The handle turned.
Slowly.
Testing.
Then harder.

The operator kept asking, “Ma'am, are you safe? Stay on the line. Units are on the way.” 
But all I could do was stare at the door handle shaking as someone tried to force it open.

After maybe ten seconds, the handle stopped.
Silence again.

Then I heard footsteps running out the back door.

The police arrived a few minutes later and swept the house, but the intruder was long gone.
The only sign they'd been there was the kitchen door: swollen wood cracked where they'd forced it open.

The officers told me I was lucky. I didn't feel lucky.
I didn't sleep in that house again for weeks.

And sometimes, late at night, I still imagine what would've happened if that bathroom door hadn't held.
